Common Strucutres:

Binary Search trees
Quees
singly Linked Lists
Undirected unweighted Graphs 
Binary Heaps
Directed GraphsHash Tables
Doubly Linked Likst
Stacks


What do they do?:

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them,
and the functions or operation that can be applied to the data. 

7 different methods to a singly linked lists.

Why so many?:

different data structure excel at differen things. Some are highly specialized, while others
like arrays are more generally used. 

Why care?:

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.

might be working with an api that returns a graph representation.

You've already worked with many of them ukniwingly. DOM traversal is a tree.

There all ecel in different situations. 

Working with map/location data? : use a graph data structure. 

If you need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?: use a linked list

Web Scraping nested HTML? : Use a tree. 

Need to write a scheduler? : Use a Binary Heap
