- Can the outpus be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problemn. 

- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem.

using the top approach
- Can I restate the problem in my own words. 

implement addition

- What are the inputs the go into the problem?

integer, or float, is an array that reduces?

- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to thr Problem

What should be result be?

- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problemn. 

This is something that you would want to ask your interviewer, or look for any information?

- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem.


function sum(num1,num2) {
  return num1+=num2;
}

sum(3,15);
