// Break it down before coding. Take the steps and write down what I need to write out. 

// You should communicate what you are doing while your coding in front of the interviewer.

// Write pseudo code so you write steps by step to do what your doing. 

charCount("aaaa"); // {a:4}
charCount("hello");// {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}

"my phone number is 12870"

"Hello hi"
charCount("");


functuon charCount(str) {
  // do something
  // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string;
}


functuon charCount(str) {
// make object to return at end
// loop over string, for each character...
// if the char is a number/letter AND key in object, add 1 to count
// if character is a number/letter AND not in object, add it and set value to 1
// if character is something else( sace, period, etc) dont do anything 

// return object at end
}

// The interveiw is really about seeing your process to solving the problem at hand.
