What is an algorithm? 

- A process of set of steps to accomplish a certain task. 

Everything we do in programming involves some sort of algorithm. 

It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer.

How do you improve?
1) Devise a plan for solving problems.
2) Master common problem solving patterns. 


Problem Solving Strategies - 

- Understand the problem
- explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look back and refactor.
