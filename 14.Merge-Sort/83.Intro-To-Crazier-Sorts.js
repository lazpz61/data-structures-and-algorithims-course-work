/*

Why learn this:

-the sorting algorithms such as bubble, insertion, and selection are not efficient for a large data set. 

*/

// MergeSort will be much faster than the simpler algorithms. 

/*

-There is a family of sorting algorithms hat can imporve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)
-There is a tradeoff between efficiency and simploicty
- the more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand.
