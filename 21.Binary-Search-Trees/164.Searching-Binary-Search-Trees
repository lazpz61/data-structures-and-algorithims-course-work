BST : why are they used

It makes it easy to look things up, and insert thing, and find a place for a node.
The search becomes really qucik. 

it makes a comparison of the date presented and take less time to find the data that you need to find. 

if it wasnt built like this you'd need to review every single node and that will take a long time. 

Compare and go to the right or the left.
