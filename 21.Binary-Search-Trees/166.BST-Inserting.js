-Create a new node
- Starting at the root.
    -Check if there is a root, if not -  the root becomes that new node!
    - If there is a root, check if the value of the new node is greater than or less than the value of the root.
    -if it is greater 
        -Check to see if there is a node to the right
            -if there is, move to that node and repeat these steps.
            -if there is not, add that node as the right property.
    -If it is less
        -Check to see if there is a node to the left
            -if there is, move to that node and repeat these steps.
            - if there is not, add that node as the left property.
