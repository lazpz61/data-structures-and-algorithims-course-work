Kinds of Trees:

- Trees
- Binary Trees
 -  special condition : each node at most can have two children. Cannot have three.


- Binary Search Trees (excels at searching)
    - The Root node can only have up to 2 child nodes. 
    - at most have two children per node. Sorted in an order. BST used to store data that can be compared.
    - can be strings or other data types to compare things.
    - if we take any node on the tree any items that is less then the root is to the left, any
        number greater is located tot he right of the root. Then its repeatd in each child node. 
    - Every Node to the right of a parent node is always less than the parent.
    - Every node to the right of a parent node is alwasy greater than the parent.
