We can solve a problem either Iteratively or Recursively.

Recursion is the idea that a function is doing one function at a time while decreasing the list it is given
so as to shrink the list of data into a single answer instead of a whole list. 

example: check if there are any odd numbers in this list

function will check to see if the first number in the list is odd. 

(3142 5798 6550 5914) - no odds
     (5798 6550 5914) - no odds
          (6550 5914) - no odds
               (5914) - no odds

taking one problem and doing it over ad over until you reach a smaller piece.

Call Stack, Helper Method, Recrusion, and Pure Recursion.

Recurse - means to call itself forever


Recursion is whena function calls itself until someone stops it.

It can be used instead of a loop.

If no one stops it, it'll recurse forever and crash your program.

A Base Case is a condition that stops the recrustion. Dont forget to add them.

Loops are ectra state variables for tracking and counting, while recursion only used the provided parameters.
