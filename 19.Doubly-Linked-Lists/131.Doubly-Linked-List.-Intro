Doubly Linked List -  we add pointers to the previous node and the next node.

Points in two directions. Large ramification and the methods.

Same as Singly Linked List except that it points to both the previous and the next node. 

We have to account for two pointers. 

This takes up more memory.

More Memory === More Flexibility.

it's almost alwasya a tradeofff!
