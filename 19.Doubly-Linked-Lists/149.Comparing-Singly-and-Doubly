Big O of Doubly Linked Lists


insertion - O(1)

Doubly Linked Lists are similar to singly linked list except that there is an additional pointer
to previous nodes. 

Representing a browser history uses a singly linked list. 

Better than sinlgy linked lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time .

However they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer.
