["Steele","Colt","Data Structures","Algorithms"].sort():

["Algorithms","Colt","",""]


The sort order is according to string unicode code points. So the sort method doesnt work well with numbers.

Telling JavaScript how to Sort.


- The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function.

- you can use this comparator function to tell Javascript how you want it to sort.

- The comparator looks at pairs of elemtns (a and b),
determines their sort order based on the return value
    -if it return a negative number, a should come before b
    -if it return a positive number, a should come after b.
    -if it returns 0, JS a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned.
