// What is a log

// it is the inverse of an exponential equation

log2 (8) = 3


/* The algorithm of a number roughly measure the number of times you can divide that number by 2
before you get a value thats less than or equal to 1.
*/


// O(log n) time complexity is good. it compares very favoarably like O(n) 

// O(nlogn) is good but not as good as O(log n) time complexity. 


// Who Cares 

// - Search algorithms, and sorting algorithms, recursion sometimes invloves logarithmic space complexity. 

// Recap

/*

- to analyze performance of an algorithm we use Big O Notation. 

- Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.

- Big O Notation doesnt care about precision, only about feneral trends ( linear, quadratic, constant)

- The time or space complexity (as measure by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, 
not the hardware used to run the algorithm.
