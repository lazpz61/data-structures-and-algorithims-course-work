DFS - InOrder:
Traversing the Nodes traversing the entire left side, and then push the value of 
the node and then traverse the right.
Creating a list in the order that they were visited.




- Create a variable to store the value of nodes visited.
- Store the root of the BST in a variable called current.
- Write a helper function which accepts a node. 
    - If the node has a left property, call the helper function.
      with the left property on the node.
    - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values.
    - If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right 
        property on the node.
- Invoke the helper function with the current variable.
