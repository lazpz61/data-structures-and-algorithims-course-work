Recap:

- Trees are non linear data structures that contain a root and child nodes.
- Binary Trees can have values of any type, but at most two children for each parent.
- Binary Search Trees are a more specific version of binary trees where every node to the left of a parent is
    less than it's value and every node to th eright is greater.
- We can search through Trees using BFS and DFS.
